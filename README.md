# Project Title

The code serves as a sort of data storage and retrieval system in the Flow Blockchain. It keeps information about Specs, such as company_name, model_name, modelno, year, and account(for example, a specification for a smart phone)

## Description

The Transaction code demonstrates how to add new specifications for a specific address, and the Title smart contract acts as a registry for specifications.

The code serves as a sort of data storage and retrieval system in the Flow Blockchain. It keeps information about Specs, such as company_name, model_name, modelno, year, and account(for example, a specification for a smart phone)

The contract provides a public function addholder to add new specification for a given address.

The transation code imports the Title smart contract and declares a transaction with parameters for specifications and an address.

The main function offers a means of querying and retrieving the specifications connected to a particular address.

Every specification's user input is gathered and recorded in the transation's code on the Flow Blockchain.

The script code also returns the Specs values.

## Getting Started
